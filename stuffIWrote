How am I doing this? God this program is so hard to use. But I guess that's more because I've been too spoiled by the user friendly interfaces of Microsoft
 Windows, eh? This is pretty fun in its own way I suppose. It's just rough in
 beginning, like with all things! Just don't let yourself get a fat head because of it. Remember, not even you are exempt from the Dunning-Kruger effect.

Wow! That actually worked, how exciting! I should just keep writing in this
 text thingy so that I get in the habit of using vim! Ah... but you know
 I kind of wonder if there are preferences like in a general use textual
 editor I'm used to using? Like replacing tabs with four spaces instead
 of an actual tab. I should look at that right now!

Huahhh okay. It's time to get some preferences up and started!

Ahhh, ahh wow! It's finally happening, I'm finally getting the hang of using
Linux to do some development work. This is where it's going to get exciting, I
can feel it!
